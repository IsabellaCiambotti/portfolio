			<div><p>For my data visualization final I created a project mapping the Black Lives Matter Twitter conversation after during the week of Freddie Gray's death. I hydrated over a million tweets from a publicly available research dataset which had compiled tweets matching keywords around #BLM, Freddie Gray, and other episodes of police violence. Using d3.js, I sorted the data by primary conversation topic, user twitter follower counts, and retweet counts. Hovering over the tweets also produces a pop-up of their text. To contextualize the tweets, I also researched national and local news sites to develop an accurate, but concise, timeline of events.<br></br>I found the required static visual more suited to exploring one of my larger research questions, which was to explore the interplay between online and offline protests. I dug through Twitter and local newspaper archives to make the most accurate guess of ground protest numbers each day. Ultimately, my intent was to give a reader multiple ways to access this data and the ability to ask their own questions.</p>

			<div><p>The South African startup Uthini has created a system of language learning between a tutor, student, and chatbot that happens entirely over a commonly-used messaging app. As a data scientist intern, much of my time was spent organizing, analyzing, and visualizing data to get an idea of student progress, curriculm weak points, and content engagement. I also had the opportunity to develop semi-supervised neural networks that could classify both English and Zulu messages into our own developed classification structure.</p></div>

			<div><p>I spent a week surveying every and any UVA student reachable by email and asked them to tell me a love story. They didn't disappoint: I got a full range of humorous, sad, gross, and touching anecdotes. I compiled the text and location data into ArcMaps. I kept the map free of labels because UVA’s campus is very recognizable to students, and more importantly, I wanted the reader to “wander” the map, exploring their own usual paths and study spots to see what else those spaces might've been witness to. Plus, what better way to celebrate Valentine's Day than reading other people's heartbreaks! This story was <a href='https://hackcville.com/pioneer/2018/02/14/love-around-grounds/' target='_blank'>originally published</a> in The Pioneer, a digital student publication.</p>

	<h1>Move</h1>

		<div class="portfolio-bottom">
			<div><p>My data visualization class used the app Move to track our movements over the course of the semester. I used Tableau to categorize the data into "times of day" and to create a visualization I was happy with. With that as a foundation, I used Illustrator to develop a visualization that explored how much our class walked and when. UVA is a pedestrian-friendly campus, and some of the dorms are far away from classes, so it made sense to me that people averaged a pretty respectable distance on weekdays. Most surprising was finding that four people in the class walked way more than anyone else.</p>
